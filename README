This is the README file for Acme::Test, a perl module for continuous
100% test coverage

Please refer to 'perldoc Acme::Test' after installation for details.


Acme::Test follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
